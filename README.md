# **Penetration Testing Engagement for Rekall Corporation**

## **Introduction**

This project documents a comprehensive penetration testing engagement performed for the fictional client, Rekall Corporation. Over the course of three days, I conducted targeted attacks on Rekall's web application, Linux servers, and Windows servers, identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. This project showcases my proficiency in ethical hacking methodologies, vulnerability assessment, exploitation techniques, and remediation strategies.
